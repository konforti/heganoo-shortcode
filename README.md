# Description

Allows the use of a special short code [heganoo] for embedding Heganoo maps.

## Example:
`[heganoo href="http://heganoo.com/embed/4474"]`

## Parameters:
- href (mandatory) - Embed URL path to a map.
- width - The CSS width value.
- height - The CSS height value.
- popup - true or false to use an image popup link.
- popupimg - URL path to a picture. Let you use a custom image popup link, when using popup
- allowfullscreen - true or false to allow full-screen of the embed map.

# Installation

Copy the folder "heganoo-shortcode" into the /wp-content/plugins/ folder. Then go to the Plugins area of the Admin and activate. Or, search for "Heganoo Shortcode Plugin" from the admin area of your WordPress site in Plugins > Add New.

## Why is this useful?

Shortcodes are clean! You can already copy and paste JavaScript or iframe code to embed a Heganoo map in to a WordPress page, but you need to make sure to be in the "Text" tab of the writing area. If a user is in the "Visual" (default) tab, the embed code will not work. Short codes will work either way.

This plugin duplicates what is already possible on WordPress.com.
